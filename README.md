# The Snake Game

According to Wikipedia, The Snake Game ‚Äú‚Ä¶originated in the 1976 two-player
arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive
longer than the other player. The concept evolved into a single-player variant
where a snake gets longer with each piece of food eaten‚Äîoften apples or eggs.‚Äù
It evolved over the decades from various cell phone versions, to a Tik Tok
favorite, and even a favorite beginning coding project for new coders.

After reading the article
‚Äú[How to plan a coding project in 8 easy steps](https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-plan-a-coding-project)‚Äù,
by Ryan Thelin I decided to use the 8 step formula to develop my own snake game.
I utilized an easy tutorial for my first draft of the game from educative.oi:
‚Äú[JavaScript snake game tutorial: Build a simple, interactive game](https://www.educative.io/blog/javascript-snake-game-tutorial)‚Äù.
I chose this tutorial for its ease and its ability to get a snake game up and
running quickly while utilizing JavaScript. Here‚Äôs a pic of what I came up with:

The game employs HTML with canvas, CSS and Javascript, to expand the
functionality. Besides learning how to use HTML with canvas, I broadened my
understanding of Javascript usage. I had a lot of fun following the 8 steps
formula. It definitely helps the coding aspect of the project go smoother when
you spend time in the beginning researching, outlining, planning and
pseudocoding! I hope you enjoy my first draft of The Snake Game!!
